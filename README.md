### Project Vision

* Define the Crawl/Walk/Run phases for the NPSP Trial. Consider what trial defaults are currently in place and how we might modify these configurations to make onboarding more seamless for new customers.  Assumption - designing trial for those orgs in the Crawl phase so that instance is as usable out of the gate as possible with the further assumption that orgs in the Walk/Run phases either have in-house or consultant to do further build-out and configurations taking advantage of advanced NPSP functionality.
