### Project Team Accomplishments

To date, we have completed default NPSP Settings, as well as defaults for the Contact and Account objects (Page Layouts, Lightning Record Page configuration, Action modification/addition, field history tracking, and Compact Layout modifications). See links below for a summary of what we did for each section of the Virtual Sprint (March 31 - April 1, 2020) as well as our next meeting on April 16, 2020. Next immediate step is to have our Release Engineering team retrieve the metadata changes to our Salesforce org and then spin up another org where we can capture the remaining changes to Opportunities, Campaigns, and other objects. Next meeting will take place on Thursday, April 30, 2020.
